Uses React Query, React Router, Zod, React Hook Form

Fully componentized structure (/api, /components, /hooks, etc.)

Responsive UI and form validation implemented

✅ Backend Goals
Node.js + Express (ES Modules)

PostgreSQL schema for users, students, academic setup, documents

Public API for certificate verification:
GET /api/verify/:identifier

✅ Database Design
Includes tables for:

users, faculties, departments, academic_years, students, documents, audit_logs

✅ API Coverage
Auth APIs: Login, logout, refresh, password reset

Student APIs: Full CRUD + bulk import

Academic Config APIs: Faculty, Department, Academic Years

Document Management: Upload, download, delete

Reports & Audit Logs

Certificate Verification API — public access endpoint

✅ Security Considerations
Zod validation, BetterAuth, CORS, rate limiting, SQL injection/XSS prevention

Role-based access control

Secure file handling

✅ Project Status
Frontend: Fully functional but runs on mock data

Backend: Pending full implementation

🔒 Important Architecture Rule
The Alumni Management System is the data backbone, but the Certificate Verification Portal is the primary public utility — and the main justification for the system’s development.
