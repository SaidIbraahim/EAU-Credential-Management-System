## üöÄ Email Implementation Options for Forgot Password

### Option 1: Resend (Recommended ‚≠ê)

**Why Resend is the best choice:**
- Modern, developer-friendly API
- Excellent deliverability (better than traditional services)
- Simple integration (just a few lines of code)
- Generous free tier (3,000 emails/month)
- Built-in security (DKIM, SPF, DMARC handled automatically)
- Real-time tracking and analytics

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Install the package:**
   ```bash
   npm install resend
   ```

2. **Get API Key:**
   - Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
   - Go to API Keys section
   - Create a new API key

3. **Add Environment Variable:**
   ```env
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Domain Setup (Important for Production):**
   - Add your domain in Resend dashboard
   - Add DNS records (DKIM, SPF, DMARC)
   - Verify domain ownership
   - Use format: `from: 'Your App <noreply@yourdomain.com>'`

**For Development/Testing:**
- You can use `onboarding@resend.dev` as the sender
- But emails will be limited and marked as test

**Implementation:**
The EmailService has been created and integrated into your auth controller:
- `EmailService.sendPasswordResetEmail()` - Sends verification code
- `EmailService.sendPasswordResetConfirmation()` - Confirms password reset
- Professional HTML templates included
- Automatic error handling and logging

### Option 2: SendGrid (Enterprise Alternative)

```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

**Environment Variables:**
```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### Option 3: Nodemailer with Gmail/Outlook

npm install nodemailer
```

**Environment Variables:**
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
