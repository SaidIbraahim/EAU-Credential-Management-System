# EAU-Credential System Production Readiness Audit Report

**Date:** December 8, 2024  
**Auditor:** AI Assistant  
**System Version:** Current Implementation  
**Scope:** Full system audit including frontend, backend, and database components

## Executive Summary

The EAU-Credential System is a comprehensive student management and certificate verification platform consisting of two main applications: an admin panel (`apps/admin`) and a public certificate verification portal (`apps/verify`), powered by a unified backend. This audit assesses the system's production readiness with particular focus on skeleton loading implementation and overall architecture.

## 1. Project Structure Assessment
